TEST PRISM EXTENSION

1. Reload the extension in chrome://extensions

2. Open a REGULAR webpage (like news.com or any article page)
   DO NOT test on chrome:// pages (extensions won't load there)

3. Open DevTools on the webpage (F12 or Cmd+Option+I)

4. Click the Prism icon in Chrome toolbar

5. In the popup, click "Analyze Page"

6. Check TWO places for console logs:
   a) Page DevTools Console (the one you opened with F12)
   b) Extension DevTools Console 
      - Go to chrome://extensions
      - Click "service worker" or "inspect views" for Prism
      - Check that console for popup.js logs

What you should see:
- In page console: "Prism: Content script loaded on: [url]"
- In page console: "Prism: Received message: ..."
- In popup console: "Prism Popup: Sending message..."

If you DON'T see "Prism: Content script loaded", the content script isn't running.
